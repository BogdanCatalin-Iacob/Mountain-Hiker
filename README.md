## Purpose
This Website was created for the sole purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. 
It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document.

The live website can be found [here]().

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        4. As a First Time user, I want to view the website and content clearly on my mobile device.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about events.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added events.
        2. As a Frequent user, I want to check to see if there are any new photos and media from the organisation activities.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

-   ### Structure
All Pages will contain a Navigation menu at the top of the Webpage that directs them to a new Page to allow users to Navigate the site easily.
The Nav Menu will be collapsable on a Mobile device to make use of space on smaller devices.
The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:
> As a First Time user, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

The Home Page will contain four benefits of hiking.
The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:
> As a First Time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

Custom CSS will be used to make the Website responsive by the use of media queries.

All pages will be responsive and the layouts will change dependant on screen size. This is to ensure content flow is appealing,
images are displayed properly and that the content is not shrunk side by side, so small that it is unreadable.
The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:
> As a First Time user, I want to view the website and content clearly on my mobile device.

All pages will contain a Footer Element with Contact Information, and Social Media Icons. The icons used will be
from font-awesome. These are referenced below in the Frameworks-Libraries-and-Programs-Used section of this document. 
The aim of the Footer elements are to fulfill user stories:
> As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.<br>
> As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.


The Gallery Page will contain several photos from various activities the organisation has engaged in.
The purpose of these galleries are to fulfill user story:
> As a Frequent user, I want to check to see if there are any new photos and media from the organisation activities.

The Contact Page will contain a form that can be used to contact the organisation through the website. This will also contain a check 
box that will allow the user to sign up for the organisation newsletter in order to keep up to date with all the news and events.
The purpose of this Page is to fulfill user stories:
> As a Returning user, I want to contact the organisation so I can request more information.<br>
> As a Frequent user, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are: "Kelly Green": #00c201 , "Snow": #fffafa , "Flame": #e4572e , "Sky Blue Crayola": #7ee8fa with shades of "White": #fff and "Black": #000. 

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Spectral font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Helvetica as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
        -   All headings throughout the website use Lora font with Arial as the fallback in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
        
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

    -   #### Wireframes
Home Page<br>
![Home Page Wireframe]()<br>
Gallery Page<br>
![Gallery Page Wireframe]()<br>
Contact Page<br>
![Contact Page Wireframe]()<br>

## Testing

-   ### Test Strategy 

    -   #### Summary 

        - Testing is required on MilestoneProject-1 â€“ Mountain Hiker Responsive Website.

        - As this project is static and contains no back-end functionality, the testing performed will be on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing to be done on at least three web browsers and all screen sizes.

        - No elements should overlap another container div. All elements should remain on the screen at all sizes above 475px.

        - All nav links should direct to the correct html pages as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html. 

        - All links to external websites must open in a new browser.

        - Testing of form validation will also be required to ensure the correct inputs are taken and that all fields are required. 

        - Validation of inclusion for all features included in the Structure of the Website / Wireframes must be performed.
